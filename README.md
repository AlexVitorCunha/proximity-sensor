# Car Proximity sensor arduino Project

Project made for the internet of things course at Georgian College.
The project was mad using the tinkercad platform to simulate a car proximity sensor using arduino.
The sensor consists of a light sensor, an LCD screen that gives the user warnings depending on the proximity and warning sound.
This reposity has the code, a photo of the assembly and a list of components, so anyone can have a better undestanding and reproduce it.
